                    <p>This is for a local haulage company. They wanted a low maintenance simple website with basic information about their company. It is compatible with desktop and mobile. I also made an accompanying mobile application for their driver to access health and safety information as well as other info such as newsletters. I am also building an e-induction platform for their drivers to receive training.</p>

                    <p>This is an example online shop built using React and users can create accounts and purchase products fully online. It is customisable to your business if required or I can build a custom platform.</p>
